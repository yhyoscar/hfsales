        <p class="text-dark mb-2" style="margin-top:10px;">Our membership follows a <strong>prepaid-recharge</strong> model: the prepaid payment will be saved in your Hephzibah member saving account, and everytime when you buy products from us, the corresponding amount will be deduct from your saving account. You can recharge your saving account anytime you like. We'll remind you when your balance is low. There is <strong>NO registration fee or service fee</strong>.</p>
        <p class="text-dark mb-0">We currently accept <strong>no-less-than $500</strong> prepaid payment for new member registration, and we offer <strong>10% discount</strong> for early-bird registration (<strong>before April 30, 2023</strong>). That means if you prepaid $500 to become a member, you will have a balance of $550 immidiately on your saving account.</p>
